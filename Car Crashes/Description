In this project, it was our goal to identify the most dangerous intersections in the Des Moines Metropolitan area and identify the road characteristics that lead to severe crashes. Human factors were ignored, as public policy only has so much control over driver behavior. This study focused on road design and how we could do better. 

This folder contains 1. A link to visualizations which identify where car crashes take place which is helpful for identifying the most dangerous intersections 2. A presentation given to Des Moines Area Metropolitan Planning Organization (DMAMPO) professionals that illustrates our findings. These findings include identifying the most dangerous intersections as well as the biggest factors in severe crashes, were found to be specific types of roads, surface conditions, and medians. Last 3. once we found correlation between road type, surface conditions, medians, and crash severity, we testing their significance using common statistical tests.

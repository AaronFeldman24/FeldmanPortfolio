In this project, we were given data on how much of a given product was sold for a retailer. We knew that consumers did not have 
much loyalty to this product, and were therefore highly price sensitive. We hypothesized, therefore, that the most significant 
predictors of quantity sold were the prices of the other top brands. So we built several models for quantity sold for the top five
brands of the product that looked like this:

where Q stands for quantity sold and S stands for price. 
model1 = lm(Q1~S1+S2+S3+S4+S5)
model2 = lm(Q2~S1+S2+S3+S4+S5)

Using the weights from these models, we entered them into an excel workbook. If one enters the prices that the retailer intends
to sell the products at as well as the prices they buy the products from the manufacturers at, the excel document will produce
an accurate estimate of quantity sold and profit. 

This folder contains that excel document, the presentation given to HyVee professionals, and the general outline of how the 
models were constructed.

I chose two datasets, one that was suitable for regression, and one that was suitable for classification. 

The classification dataset was on the top five teams from the English Premier Soccer League, and I used the predictor columns and a Perceptron algorithm to predict whether the players made their national team. I also created a kNN algorithm and compared the two, and found that kNN was more effective.

The regression dataset had numeric variables on homes, which I used to predict the value of specific homes. I used an SGDRegressor and Random Forest Trees and determined that the Random Forest Trees performed better.
